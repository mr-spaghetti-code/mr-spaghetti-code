*Building interactive experiences at the intersection of code, art, and emerging tech.*

🌐 **[www.joao.contact](https://www.joao.contact)** | 💼 Chief Product Officer at **[Catena Labs](https://www.catenalabs.com)** building an AI-native bank (think AI agents + stablecoins!)

## What I Do

By day, I'm the **Chief Product Officer at [Catena Labs](https://www.catenalabs.com)**, where we're building the infrastructure for AI-native financial institutions. I help shape products that combine cutting-edge AI with financial services, working at the intersection of machine learning, fintech, and user experience.

By night (and weekends), I'm passionate about **creative coding** and building **interactive experiences** that push the boundaries of what's possible on the web. My personal projects span everything from real-time fractal generators to AI-powered art collectors, always with a focus on making technology more expressive and engaging.

### 🎨 **Interactive Art & Visuals**
- **Real-time fractal generation** with WebGPU acceleration
- **Music visualization** that turns audio into immersive 3D experiences  
- **ASCII art plotting** with vector path generation
- **Digital art galleries** for Apple TV and web platforms

### 🤖 **AI & Automation**
- **Autonomous AI agents** that collect and curate digital art
- **Multilingual content generation** from audio to video
- **Smart contract analysis** for web3 security
- **Podcast intelligence** and processing tools

### 🌐 **Audio-Visual Experiences**
- **3D games** driven by real-time market data
- **Music-reactive environments** with physics-based animations
- **Multi-stage audio processing** for energy extraction and visualization
- **Interactive media** that responds to user input and external data

## 🛠 Languages & Tech Stack

**Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Three.js, WebGPU, SwiftUI  
**Backend**: Node.js, Python, Supabase  
**Creative**: p5.js, Remotion, Hershey fonts, GLSL shaders  
**AI/ML**: Anthropic Claude, Whisper, MediaPipe, scikit-learn

### [🎬 Podcast to Video](https://github.com/mr-spaghetti-code/podcast-to-video-multilingual)
Generate TikTok-style videos with animated captions from audio input, complete with multilingual translation and synthesis.

## 🎯 What Drives Me

I believe technology should be **expressive, interactive, and fun**. Whether I'm building AI that appreciates art, creating visualizations that respond to music, or generating fractals with hand gestures, I'm always exploring how code can create more engaging and meaningful experiences.

This philosophy extends to my professional work in fintech, where I help design AI-powered financial products that are not just functional, but intuitive and delightful to use. I love finding the sweet spot where complex technology meets simple, elegant user experiences.

My projects often combine multiple disciplines: **computer graphics meets machine learning**, **blockchain meets creative coding**, **audio processing meets 3D visualization**. I love finding unexpected connections between different technologies and using them to build something entirely new.

## 🚀 Current Interests

- **WebGPU** for high-performance browser graphics
- **AI agents** with personality and autonomous decision-making
- **Real-time audio analysis** for reactive experiences
- **Generative art** and procedural content creation
- **Cross-platform development** (web, mobile, Apple TV)
